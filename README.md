## Summary

Pocket Pokedex is an android app that displays a scrollable list of Pokemon, with details including their images, abilities, and names. 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üì≤‚ôæÔ∏èüñºÔ∏è

## Notes

I learned a lot about styling and customization while making this app, and I like how the UI turned out. I'm also happy with the infinite scroll effect, and I'm looking forward to exploring more APIs in the future!
